# ParkerGMadLibsEndpoint

This program takes inputs from the user through the URL, creates a story using those inputs, and then outputs the story to the user

Replace the 'xxxx' with your local host

First type https://localhost:xxxx/MadLib  to get the instructions on how to complete the rest of the program

This is the main way to run the program. Be sure to replace the 'xxxx' with your local host, and fill out the inputs that are required from you. They are
adjective, noise, verb, exclamation, bodypart, a person, a character from an animated program, an animal, a verb that ends in -s, and an adjective that ends in -est.

https://localhost:xxxx/{MadLib}/{MadLibs}/{adjective}/{noise}/{verb}/{exclamation}/{bodypart}/{person}/{character}/{animal}/{verb(-s)}/{adjective(-est)}

First of all the story is awesome and hilarious! I like that he has en endpoint to give instructions to the user. Code is very clean and simple and program runs perfectly. Great work.
